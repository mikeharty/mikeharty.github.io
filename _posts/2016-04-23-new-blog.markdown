This site serves as a journal of sorts for my hobbies and ideas.
 
The content I write here is primarily for myself.
 
In the past I've made the mistake of filtering ideas for my website through a "usefulness" filter.
This led to fewer posts and time wasted deliberating about whether a topic was worth writing about. 

Going forward, I'll be writing about whatever I happen to be curious about at any given moment, regardless of utility, relevant, topic, or depth.

If you find a topic I've written about here that you'd like to discuss, feel free to email me: **mike at this domain.**
